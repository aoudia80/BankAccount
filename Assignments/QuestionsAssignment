Question3:  What's difference between literal approach and new keyword approach of String object creation?
	  Both expressions give you a string object, the difference is when you create a String object using the new()	
	  operator it creates it in the heap memory
	  in the other hand when you create an object using String literal syntax it may return an existing 
	  object from String pool for future reuse  
	 
Question4:  What is the difference between == operator and equals() ?
			
		== operator checks if both objects are in the same memory location but equals method used to compare objects
